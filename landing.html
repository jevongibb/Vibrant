    <h1 class="title">Strengthening communities by improving productivity, opportunity, and the connections between us all.</h1>
    <p>How does a community create inclusive economic growth? Many people are trying to answer this question as their communities
      experience increased inequality and stagnant incomes. Increased productivity – output per working hour – is an obvious
      part of the answer. Increased opportunity – measured in terms of absolute and relative economic mobility – plays a
      less obvious, but equally important role. To increase productivity and opportunity, though, we need to understand how
      communities might grow, and how individuals relate to that growth.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Vibrant Networks uses network analysis and basic machine learning to understand how individuals combine to create companies,
      how companies combine to create industries, industries create clusters, clusters create networks, and how networks
      relate to each other.</p>
