    "underCountiesText": "The graph below shows number of employees by Traded industry, while the table below it provides additional information. Note the large amount of activity in technology, corporate headquarters, universities - go Longhorns! - and hospitality/tourism. Austin has an enviable mix of industries, composed of companies that employ highly educated, tech-savvy occupations.",
    "underActivityText": "For Austin, we see growth in tech industries like Data Processing and Custom Computer Programming Services. The tech industry fuels much of the region's growth.",
    "underTrendsText": "For Austin, as compared to the bubble graph from earlier, we see the close relationship between its service industry. We see all the activity in Arts & Hospitality, but notice that those industries are not very similar to the high productivity parts of the network. We also see that, while Austin has important manufacturing activity in industries such as Semiconductors, that part of the network does not drive Austin's employment trends.",
    "underNetworkText": "The network maps make even more sense when compared to each other. In the future, you can easily click between network maps using the Graphs tab above. For now, you can learn more about Austin by searching for Biotech using the box in the top-left. If you click Biotech, you see that this node is gray and small, but surrounded by large green nodes. Maybe this is a great opportunity for Austin? This is one of the many reasons that city leaders have invested in the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin.",
    "aboveLocalText": "In Austin, the hospitality industry turns many Local industries into Traded. The red circles in the Top 10 below are food trucks and bars. In most cities, these have Relative Size closer to 1. In Austin, they are bigger for a reason. In turn, Austin should consider supporting these activities like they would other Traded industries. The Bottom 10 also highlights the lack of public transportation in Austin. The city has been fighting over this for decades. The table can be even more helpful. If someone asks whether a region has as many restaurants - the largest employer in most regions - as might be expected, the Relative Size can answer that question."

    "city": "Tupelo",
    "state": "Mississippi",
    "underCountiesText": "The graph below shows number of employees by Traded industry, while the table below it provides additional information. Tupelo is a less populated region that has historically specialized in furniture manufacturing. While it has recently diversified into industries like auto manufacturing, those other activities remain relatively small. Tupelo's industries have companies that hire occupations like assemblers, welders, and technicians.",
    "underActivityText": "For Tupelo, we again see the important of furniture manufacturing, which shrunk from 2006 to 2011 but has recently seen some growth, and the rise of some small activity in auto manufacturing.",
    "underTrendsText": "For Tupelo, as compared to the bubble graph from earlier, we see the relative isolation of its manufacturing industry, and the lack of activity throughout the rest of the network. Tupelo's situation raises significant issues about international trade - if trade generate net gains by sacrificing lower-paying manufacturing jobs for higher-paying service jobs, Tupelo absorbs all of the loss and none of the benefit.",
    "underNetworkText": "The network maps make even more sense when compared to each other. In the future, you can easily click between network maps using the Graphs tab above. For now, you can learn more about Tupelo by clicking the Upholstered Household Furniture Manufacturing node, and then try to find a path to other parts of the network by clicking from node to node where connections exist. We will do a more robust version of this later.",
    "aboveLocalText": "In Tupelo, looking at Relative Size of Local industries highlights Outdoor Power Equipment Stores and Manufactured Home Dealers that supply consumers from throughout the larger area surrounding it. We can use the table below to check whether other Local industries employ as many people as we might expect. If someone asks whether a region has as many restaurants - the largest employer in most regions - as might be expected, the Relative Size can answer that question."

    "city": "Detroit",
    "state": "Michigan",
    "underCountiesText": "The graph below shows number of employees by Traded industry, while the table below it provides additional information. The group of counties we used to define Detroit has a large population, which is why the circles are so big. We can also see how Detroit's historical activity in manufacturing has yielded to current activity in the service industry. That transition disrupted employment opportunities for manufacturing occupations - like those in Tupelo - while making way for highly educated, tech-savvy occupations - like those in Austin.",
    "underActivityText": "For Detroit, we do not see any major movement in its industries. The major trend is a lack of change, which reflects the unfortunate stagnation of the region's economy.",
    "underTrendsText": "For Detroit, as compared to the bubble graph from earlier, we notice a relatively diversified network with activity in many high-productivity industries. Detroit's problem was that its manufacturing nodes used to be much bigger. When they shrunk, it not only lost jobs in its Traded manufacturing industries, but it lost the Local jobs in restaurants and other industries that the Traded occupations supported. ",
    "underNetworkText": "The network maps make even more sense when compared to each other. In the future, you can easily click between network maps using the Graphs tab above. For now, you can learn more about Detroit by looking at all the small green nodes that surround Corporate, Subsidiary, and Regional Managing Offices. These are larger in most thriving cities. After shrinking for so long and then regaining its balance, Detroit needs to figure out how to grow again. It needs to expand these green nodes.",
    "aboveLocalText": "In Detroit, we see that two industries that typically behave like Local are actually Traded. Due to Detroit's auto industry, Motor Vehicle Supplies and New Parts Merchant Wholesalers is much larger than we would expect, both in terms of Relative Size and absolute number of employees. Testing Laboratories is also very large. When thinking about Traded industries in this region, these industries should be included. The table can also be helpful. If someone asks whether a region has as many restaurants - the largest employer in most regions - as might be expected, the Relative Size can answer that question."
